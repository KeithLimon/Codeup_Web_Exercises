<h1>Hello World</h1>

	<body>
	<p> My name is Keith and I was born in San Antonio.</p>

	<p> Growing up I always thought I was a <em>"tech-savvy"</em> person in the way that i could install games on my computer, and play them. But as soon as problems would arise or i would have to map controls I would call my brother who <strong>actually</strong> know how to do stuff and fix them for me. That is a good summery of my experience with computers and such tech.
	</p>

	<p> Being a creative person was where I became more savvy. <strong>Art</strong> and books became my real intrest as I grew up.
	</p>

<h2>My Vehicle</h2>

<p>The cat mobile! It's fuel efficient, runs on cat nip and cuteness, and is low maintenace. What more could a commuter want?  Some day I hope to be able to throw a saddle around my cats back and ride it into the sunset. </p>
